# CST 338 Final Project
This was the final project I created for CST 338 in Fall 2018.
# Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create an Android app that would emulate a flight reservation system. 
Some key ideas we learned relevant to the project:
* Android applcation lifecylce
* Using SQLite to make data persistent
* Use intents to create new views and send information to those views
* Formatting views using XML
# Testing
This project was manually tested on a physical device.
